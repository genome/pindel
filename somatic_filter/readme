This is the initial implementation of somatic indel filtering for Pindel indel calls based on ICGC DREAM challenge round 3 test result. Please advise. contact kye@genome.wustl.edu

step 1: extract indel summary lines using
grep ChrID pindel_output_D > D.head
grep ChrID pindel_output_SI > SI.head

step 2: run the provided perl script with an updated configuration file
perl somatic_indelfilter.pl somatic.indel.filter.config

Somatic indel calls will be stored as a VCF file with the name specified in the configuration file.

We assume normal-tumor paired genome runs by pindel, and that the normal sample comes first in the pindel output file.
